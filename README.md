the perpetual motion machine


-- since i have the abis, which provided all event and function signatures. lets leave raw data in the logs undecoded. instead create a new map that is used to derive meaning from the encoded logs. contractAddress -> event signature -> topics[1/2/3]. Then i need to map each indexed parameter in the event signature by name to its corresponding value  from the data field.
